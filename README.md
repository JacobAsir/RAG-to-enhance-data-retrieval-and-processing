# RAG-to-enhance-data-retrieval-and-processing

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Utilized WebBaseLoader to scrape documentation from LangChain's website. This step ensured that our data source was comprehensive and relevant for the tasks at hand.

𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴: Implemented RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to address the context size limitations of large language models (LLMs). This tool divided documents into manageable chunks, allowing for seamless processing.

𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: 
Developed embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings, which are crucial for capturing semantic meanings of the document contents.
Stored these embeddings in a FAISS vector store, enabling quick and efficient similarity searches. This storage solution is pivotal for retrieving relevant information accurately.

𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹: Constructed a retrieval chain to query the vector store and extract precise information based on specific queries. This was achieved by creating a custom document chain using ChatOpenAI, which facilitated context-aware responses.

𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹-𝗔𝘂𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗥𝗔𝗚) 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: By combining retrieval and generative capabilities, I ensured that the system could deliver accurate and context-enriched answers. This approach significantly reduced inaccuracies and improved the quality of outputs.
